NOTE: This library requires Gradle 4 and JDK 8

NOTE: This library is under development and not final released.


== Summary
This plugin generates a component descriptor, that can be used for deployments on any platforms. It is possible to
add modules (eg Intershop Cartridges), libraries, zip files (container), single files and properties for different
installation and environemnt types and operating systems (classifier). The configuration contains also the installation
target.
There is also an deployment plugin, that used the descriptor for an installation.

== Usage
To apply the component-build Gradle Plugin to your projects, add the following in your build script:

[source,groovy]
[subs=+attributes]
.build.gradle
----
plugins {
    id 'com.intershop.gradle.component.build' version '{latestRevision}'
}

component {
    // component configuration
}
----
